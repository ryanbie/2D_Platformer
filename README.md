# 2D Platformer Game

This a 2D Platformer game that I am currently working on. 
I started this project on September 2nd 2017. 
This project involves the use of C# and Unity. 

## Motivation

I have decided to create this project because I have always been interested in creating video games. As an avid gamer, I decided that the first approach to building games is to start now. So I decided to take the plunge and learn Unity and C# and hope to create big AAA launch titles in the future. 

## Installation 

The user must have Unity installed onto their computer. Microsoft Visual Studio is highly recommended to view and edit C# code but not required. Unity has a C# IDE packaged into it already, however, I prefer the UI on VS.
